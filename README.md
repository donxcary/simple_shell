Simple Shell project for ALX Software Engineering program.
Is it a simple UNIX command interpreter written in C language.
It can be compiled using gcc and works on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
It is a simple UNIX command interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
The shell implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, along with built in history and line editing capabilities. 
It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts). 
That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell. 
The shell has several prompts, which it uses to indicate what kind of input it is expecting. Each prompt signals a different kind of input. 
The default prompt, printed when the shell is ready to read a command, is $ . The shell is not a complete programming language, but includes the following constructs:

Variables
Quoting
Comments
Arithmetic
Expansions
Functions
Signals
Comments
Command Execution
